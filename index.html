		<span> I had originally wanted to let the user to choose which city, but my requests kept getting rejected when choosing a city, which was pretty much the last step. If I had been able to fiddle with the API more, I would have liked to have fixed the select options so that the lower tier select options change as the higher tier options change. As of now, if I select USA and then change the country to somewhere else, the states' options still show the states from USA. The same goes for the city options.</span>

		<span>As a place holder, I'm displaying the current weather for Los Angeles.</span>
